#Ideas for project:

- Stick the thermistor in a container, heat it up and use idea gas law

- 


#What Physics do I know:

- Pendulum

** - Oscillations (Damped and Forced)
	- The door stopper. Measuring sound and oscilliation as well, modeling and comparing. 
	
	
**- Ideal Gas Law
	- Quart containter with a hole cut in it. Measure both pressure and temperature as one increases by either adding material or heat.
	
**- Drag Coefficients
	- Dropping objects with similar/known shapes of drag coefficients, measuring their distance and solving for their drag coefficient to known values.

* - Determining the frequencies of light in relation to their color

- 
	
	
- double slit, single slit (don't really want to do that)
